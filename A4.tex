\section{32.1-2} Suppose that all characters in the pattern $P$ are different. Show how to accelerate NAIVESTRING-MATCHER to run in time $O(n)$ on an $n$-character text $T$.\\
\textcolor{blue}{Answer:}

\section{32.2-3}
Show how to extend the Rabin-Karp method to handle the problem of looking for a given $m\times m$ pattern in an $n \times n$ array of characters. (The pattern may be shifted vertically and horizontally, but it may not be rotated.)\\
\textcolor{blue}{Answer:}

\section{34.2-2}
Prove that if $G$ is an undirected bipartite graph with an odd number of vertices, then $G$ is nonhamiltonian.\\
\textcolor{blue}{Answer:}

\section{34.2-7}
Show that the hamiltonian-path problem can be solved in polynomial time on directed acyclic graphs. Give an efficient algorithm for the problem.\\
\textcolor{blue}{Answer:}

\section{34.3-1}
Verify that the circuit in Figure 34.8(b) is unsatisfiable.\\
\textcolor{blue}{Answer:}

\section{34.5-6}
Show that the hamiltonian-path problem is NP-complete.\\
\textcolor{blue}{Answer:}

\section{} The longest-simple-cycle problem is the problem of determining a simple cycle (no repeated vertices) of maximum length in a graph. Show that this problem is NP-complete.\\
\textcolor{blue}{Answer:}

\section{} Professor Nixon proposes the following heuristic to solve the vertex-cover problem. Repeatedly select a vertex of highest degree, and remove all of its incident edges. Give an example to show that the professor's heuristic does not have an approximation ratio of $2$.
(Hint: Try a bipartite graph with vertices of uniform degree on the left and vertices of varying degree on the right.)\\
